## ✅ Compliance & Safety

This project respects website policies.

- `SCRAPING_ENABLED`: set to `true` **only after** confirming the target site's Terms of Service permit scraping and your use case. Defaults to disabled.
- `TOS_CONFIRMED`: set to `true` once you've reviewed and accepted the target site's terms for your use case.
- `robots.txt` is fetched and enforced; if unavailable or disallowing a path, scraping is skipped.
